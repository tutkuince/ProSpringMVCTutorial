	/**
	 * AOP Solution
	 * Apply the Proxy design pattern
	 * 
	 *  Benefits of AOP
	 *  + Code for Aspect is defined in a single class
	 *  	- Much better than being scattered everywhere
	 *  	- Promotes code reuse and easier to change
	 *  + Business code in your application is cleaner
	 *  	- Only applies to business functionality: addAccount
	 *  	- Reduces code complexity
	 *  + Configurable
	 *  	- Based on configuration, apply Aspects selectively to different parts of app
	 *  	- No need to make changes to main application code (Very Important)
	 *  
	 *  Additional AOP Use Cases
	 *  + Most common
	 *  	- logging, security, transactions
	 *  + Audit logging
	 *  	-who, what, when, where
	 *  + Exception handling
	 *  	- log exception and notify DevOps team via SMS/email
	 *  + API Management
	 *  	- how many times has a method been called user
	 *  	- analytics: what are peak times? what is average load? who is top user?
	 * 
	 * Advantages
	 * + Reusable modules
	 * + Resolve code tangling
	 * + Resolve code scatter
	 * + Applied selectively based on configuration
	 * 
	 * Disadvantages
	 * + Too many aspects and app flow is hard to follow
	 * + Minor performance cost for aspect execution ( run-time weaving )
	 *
